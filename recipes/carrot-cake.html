		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This classic carrot cake recipe is not overly spiced, and it has texture from the grated carrots, shredded coconut, chopped nuts and raisins. If your dried fruit feels dry, plump it either by steaming the fruit for a couple of minutes; pouring boiling water over the fruit then draining it; or even just running it under hot tap water. Pat the fruit dry before using it. There’s enough frosting to fill the layers and cover the sides and top of the cake, but each layer is covered generously, so generously that when the next layer goes on the frosting ripples out around the edges. Then just swirl the frosting over the top, leaving the sides bare.</p>

			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
				<li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
				<li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
				<li>3 cups grated carrots</li>
				<li>1 cup coarsely chopped nuts</li>
				<li>1 cup shredded coconut</li>
				<li>1/2 cup moist, plump raisins</li>
				<li>2 cups sugar</li>
				<li>1 cup canola or safflower oil</li>
				<li>4 large eggs</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>For the cake: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter and flour three 9-inch round, 2-inch deep cake pans, flour the insides and tap out the excess.</li>
				<li>Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt and set aside. In another bowl, stir together the carrots, chopped nuts, coconut and raisins.</li>
				<li>Working in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a whisk, beat the sugar and oil together until smooth. Add the eggs one by one and continue to beat until the batter is even smoother. If you are working in a mixer, reduce the speed to low, if you're working by hand switch to a large rubber spatula, and gently stir in the flour mixture — mix only until the dry ingredients disappear. Just as gently, stir in the chunky ingredients.</li>
				<li>Divide the batter among the baking pans and slide the pans into the oven. Bake the cakes for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pans top to bottom and front to back at the midway point. The cakes are properly baked when a knife inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean; the cakes will just start to come away from the edges. Transfer the pans to cooling racks, cool for 5 minutes, then turn out onto racks to cool to room temperature. (At this point, the cakes can be wrapped airtight and kept at room temperature overnight or frozen for up to 2 months; thaw before frosting.)</li>
